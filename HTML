            <font color="11affe"> Dear Visitor,
                Welcome to my Rajasthan, fascinating Rajasthan.

                This land is a colourful melange of massive forts, stunning palaces, diverse cultures, delectable
                cuisines and
                warm people, set amidst a rugged yet inviting landscape.

                It is a land that has inspired me and countless others. Come tread on the sands of time. In Rajasthan
                you will
                find every hue in Nature's grand palette - the red sands, the blue of royalty, the pink cities or the
                amber
                sunsets. Surrender yourself to the sounds of trinkets or the sounds of the all conquering wind. Sight
                and sounds
                that are far removed from any city. Sights and sounds that will transport you into a folk lore.

                Music, art and dance is woven into every inch of this land I call paradise. You will find it carved in
                every
                grain of sand. Here you will find the past, the present and the future. You will find passion. You will
                find
                adventure. And you will find yourself.

                Come, walk into the unforgettable embrace of my Rajasthan.

        <p>
            <font color="11fe1f">Jaipur is the capital of India’s Rajasthan state. It evokes the royal family that once
                ruled the region and
                that, in 1727, founded what is now called the Old City, or “Pink City” for its trademark building color.
                At
                the center of its stately street grid (notable in India) stands the opulent, colonnaded City Palace
                complex.
                With gardens, courtyards and museums, part of it is still a royal residence. </font>
